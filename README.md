# Pokemon XD:Gale of Darkness Editor Tool

  This tool is a C# based Windows GUI tool to edit the Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness and Colosseum games on the Gamecube. It was based on the original tool developed by 
[StarsMMD](https://github.com/StarsMmd/GoD-Tool/tree/main). His tool is truly amazing, but porting Swift over to Windows causes its fair share of issues, particularly with
implimenting a GUI. This project is a WIP build with heavy reference to the original tool to hopefully create a long awaiting Windows GUI experience.

## Features
- Largely...none for now (as of 6/30/23)
- Reads GameID and identifies game title as a result, alongside with the file size and the path to the file being edited.

## Planned Features
- Add a free file space estimate as a part of the initial iso load
- Add the cleanup feature to delete unused files
- Impliment randomizer logic
- Every new file loaded will generate a random Pokemon body sprite
- Add values to sliders and apply the operations to the reqired bytes
- Trainer editor menu mimicing the same style as the original Mac tool
- Much more but I'm too tired to add more here rn
